  <h1>What are Html5 Semantic Elements?</h1>

<p>Semantic elements are elements with a <strong>meaning</strong>. Within html5, this means using elements (or tags)
with a clearly defined meaning that is easily interpreted by the user and the browser. This is in contrast
to the previous practice of using div or span tags, with IDs and classes, which tell the user nothing about
their content.</p>

<p>The some important advantages of the use of semantic elements are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cleaner markup: Developers' code is more readable and easier to maintain.</li>
  <li>Communication: Browsers and search engines are better able to determine the meaning of the page and content.</li>
  <li>Accessibility: Allows screen readers and other assistive technologies to better understand the meaning and structure of the page.</li>
</ul>
